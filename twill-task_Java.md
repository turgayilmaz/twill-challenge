# Twill coding challenge

## Summary

To get an understanding of how you work with Java & Spring, we'd like you to complete the following task.

Using Spring, develop a restful API allowing clients to query for users and their repositories.

The API will provide the following endpoints:

### Get user by username

For data model please see https://api.github.com/users/USERNAME

### Create user

For data model please see https://api.github.com/users/USERNAME

### Get user repositories by username

For data model please see https://api.github.com/users/USERNAME/repos

### Create repository

For data model please see https://api.github.com/users/USERNAME/repos

## Notes

- We do not expect this to be a production ready system, we are simply looking at how you approach a problem and structure your work - please do not spend more than 3-4 hours on this!
- A database is not required, it is enough to use an in memory DB or simply stub out the data.
- Use Java 8 features where possible.
- If you want to write tests, please do so.
- Feel free to use the Spring "starter" projects.
- Please include basic instructions on how to build & run the application.
